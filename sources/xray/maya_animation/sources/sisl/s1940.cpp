*********************************************************************
*
* Purpose: To remove as many knots as possible from the spline curve
*	   "oldcurve" without perturbing the curve more than a given
*	   tolerance. The tolerance is given by "eps" and the
* 	   approximation by "newcurve".
*
*
* Input:
*          oldcurve    - pointer to the original spline curve. 
*
*	   eps	       - sisl_double array giving the desired absolute accuracy
*                        of the final approximation as compared to oldcurve.
*                        If oldcurve is a spline curve in a space of
*			 dimension dim, then eps must have length dim.
*                        Note that it is not relative, but absolute accuracy
*                        that is being used. This means that the difference
*                        in component i at any parameter value, between
*                        the given curve and the approximation, is to be
*                        less than eps[i]. Note that in such comparisons
*                        the same parametrization is used for both curves.
*
*	   startfix    - the number of derivatives to be kept fixed at
*			 the beginning of the knot interval.
*                        The (0 - (startfix-1)) derivatives will be kept fixed.
*                        If startfix <0, this routine will set it to 0.
*                        If startfix< the order of the curve, this routine
*                        will set it to the order.
*
*	   endfix      - the number of derivatives to be kept fixed at
*		         the end of the knot interval.
*                        The (0 - (endfix-1)) derivatives will be kept fixed.
*                        If endfix <0, this routine will set it to 0.
*                        If endfix< the order of the curve, this routine
*                        will set it to the order.
*
*          iopen       - Open/closed parameter.
*                        =  1 : Produce open curve.
*                        =  0 : Produce closed, non-periodic curve if possible.
*                        = -1 : Produce closed, periodic curve if possible.
*
*	   itmax       - maximum number of iterations. The routine will
*                        follow an iterative procedure trying to remove
*                        more and more knots. The process will almost always
*                        stop after less than 10 iterations and it will often
*                        stop after less than 5 iterations. A suitable
*                        value for itmax is therefore usually in the region
*                        3-10.
*
*
*
*
* Output:
*          newcurve    - the spline approximation on the reduced
*                        knot vector.
*	   maxerr      - sisl_double array containing an upper bound for the
*			 pointwise error in each of the components of the
*		         spline approximation. The two curves oldcurve and
*			 newcurve are compared at the same parameter value,
*                        i.e., if oldcurve is f and newcurve is g, then
*			               |f(t)-g(t)| <= eps
*			 in each of the components.
*
*           stat       - status message
*                           > 0      : warning
*                           = 0      : ok
*                           < 0      : error
*
*
*
*
* Method:
*     The method is described in two papers listed as references below.
*     First, the knots of the input spline, s, are ranked according to their
*     relative importance in the representation of s (s1353). Using this
*     information, knots are removed from s and an approximation g is computed
*     on the reduced knot vector (s1950) with the error guaranteed to be
*     less than the tolerance in all components. In order to remove more knots,
*     the knots of g are ranked, and then knots are removed from g, resulting
*     in a spline h with even fewer knots. The knot vector of h is then
*     clearly a subsequence of the knot vector of s and s is approximated
*     on this knot vector (s1943). If the error is less than the tolerance
*     then h is accepted as the new best approximation and stored in g.
*     If the error is greater than the tolerance, knots are removed directly
*     from s based on the ranking of g resulting in a new g. In either case a
*     new best approximation g is obtained, and we can continue the iteration.
*     The iterations stop when no more knots can be removed or all the interior
*     knots have been removed. (The names s, g, and h are not used in the
*     code.)
*
* NB! The iopen parameter will be satisfyed only if the original curve
*     provides the possibility for it. For instance if the original curve
*     is open, and a closed curve is expected, this will in general not be
*     possible.
